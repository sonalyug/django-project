                        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong foundation in Django, React, and modern web technologies. I'm currently building my portfolio through hands-on projects that combine my technical skills with creative problem-solving.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge with fellow developers. I'm particularly interested in data visualization, responsive design, and creating seamless user experiences.</p>
